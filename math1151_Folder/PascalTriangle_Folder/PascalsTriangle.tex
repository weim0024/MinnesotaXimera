\begin{enumerate} 

\item In how many ways can two colored balls, red (R) and blue (B) be arranged in order?

\bigskip

{\bf {Answer:}} 2 - RB and BR

\item In how many ways can three colored balls, red (R), blue (B) and yellow (Y) be arranged in order? Write out the complete list.

\item In how many ways can four colored balls, red (R), blue (B), yellow (Y) and green (G) be arranged in order?

\begin{itemize}

\item Person 1 - Write out the possibilities that begin with R.

\item Person 2 - Write out the possibilities that begin with B.

\item Person 3 - Write out the possibilities that begin with Y.

\item Person 4 - Write out the possibilities that begin with G.

\end{itemize}

\item In how many ways can five colored balls, red (R), blue (B), yellow (Y), green (G) and purple (P) be arranged in order?

\begin{itemize}

\item Person 1 - Write out the possibilities that begin with PR.

\item Person 2 - Write out the possibilities that begin with PB.

\item Person 3 - Write out the possibilities that begin with PY.

\item Person 4 - Write out the possibilities that begin with PG.

\end{itemize}

\item In how many ways can $n$ colored balls be arranged in order?

\item In how many ways can three balls from among five colored balls, red (R), blue (B), yellow (Y), green (G) and purple (P) be arranged in order?

\begin{itemize}

\item Person 1 - Write out the possibilities that begin with R.

\item Person 2 - Write out the possibilities that begin with B.

\item Person 3 - Write out the possibilities that begin with Y.

\item Person 4 - Write out the possibilities that begin with G.

\item Person 5 - Write out the possibilities that begin with P.

\end{itemize}

\item In how many ways can $k$ balls from among $n$ colored balls be arranged in order?

\item How many of the permutations in problem 6 contain the colors R,G,B in some order? In other words, how many ways are there to order the colors R,G,B. How is this related to problem 2?

\item In how many ways can $k$ balls from among $n$ colored balls be chosen, if order doesn't matter? In other words, how many combinations are there?

\newpage

\item The notation for the number of combinations of $k$ balls from a total of $n$ balls is 

read '$n$ choose $k$' and denoted

\[
\left( {\begin{array}{*{20}c}
n \\
k\\
\end{array}} \right)
\]

Find 

\[
\left( {\begin{array}{*{20}c}
6 \\
3 \\
\end{array}} \right)
\]

and  

\[
\left( {\begin{array}{*{20}c}
9 \\
2 \\
\end{array}} \right)
\]

\item

Show the recursion in Pascal's Triangle works for combinations in this example: Show that the number of combinations of 4 colors chosen from 10 equals the number of combinations of 4 colors chosen from 9 plus the number of combinations of 3 colors chosen from 9. Hint: Examine the 10th color. In how many combinations is the 10th color present? In how many combinations is the 10th color not present?
