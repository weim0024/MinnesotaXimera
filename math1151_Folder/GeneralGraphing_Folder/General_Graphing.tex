\begin{abstract}
In this activity, you will discover how translations, reflections, and magnifications affect the shape of a graph.

For this activity, you may wish to split yourself into groups to work on the various aspects of each graphing problem.
\end{abstract}

\maketitle

The Desmos graph below displays the graph of $y=x^2$, which you will be using in this activity.
You can edit this to see the shapes of graphs of other functions.
By the end of this activity, you should be able to graph a function that has been translated, reflected, or magnified, knowing what the original function looks like.
